# Lid-Cavity-Problem
1. Walls 1, 2 and 3 are static whereas wall 4 moves with constant speed u. 
2. 2D flow inside the lid driven cavity problem governed by 2D Navier Stokes equations,
  has been solved computationally by using primitive variable approach. 
3. Non dimensional form of Navier Stokes equation has been solved with cavity being assumed to be square shaped. 
4. Velocity field, shear on top wall, midsection velocity, stream function and velocity contours are plotted.
5. For all cases, grid resolution has been maintained to be same as 100 by 100. 
6. Time step is variable.
