# Lid-Cavity-Problem
1. Walls 1, 2 and 3 are static whereas wall 4 moves with constant speed u. 
2. 2D flow inside the lid driven cavity problem is given by 2D Navier Stokes equations which 
  has been solved computationally by using primitive variable approach. 
3. Non dimensional form of Navier Stokes equation has been solved with cavity being assumed to be of square in shape. 
4. Velocity field, shear on top wall, midsection velocity, stream function and velocity contours are plotted.
5. For all cases, grid resolution has been maintained to be same as 100 by 100. 
6. Variable time step size has been used.
